- **e.**
Each type of text file creates different times but all have a similar ratio from huffman to fixed-length.
There is a variation all around the 0.6-0.7 range with the f1.text outliar of 0.23. Huffman coding should create
a balanced tree during it process which is more efficient than its fixed-length coding counterpart.
